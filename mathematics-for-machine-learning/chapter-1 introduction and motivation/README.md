# Introduction and Motivation

So we want to create a algorithm that **automatically** extract valuable information from data. This kind of algorithm is called machine learning

### **Data**

We have a habit of grouping things based on perceived commonalities, and we often save this information in other forms so that we can review it or perform custom operations on it. This collection of organized information is what we call data.

### Model

We also want to identify patterns within the data. Is there a trend over time? How does the average change? To achieve this, we create a model. The model receives the data and returns the information we are interested in. We use model to predict or generate a data.

Model is also called predictor.

### Machine Learning

Machine learning is one of many approaches used to discover a model.

The optimization of the model is performed by the machine rather than through explicit mathematical equations created by humans, so we can say it "automatically" finds the model.

Additionally, the optimization process is done gradually by the machine, as if it’s learning how to create a good model. In the field of machine learning, this gradual improvement is what we refer to as "learning."

### Data as Numbers

Fundamentally, computers calculate only numbers, so we have to convert our data into a numerical format.

The numerical format that we convert our data into is called a vector. We will learn more about vectors in the following chapters.

### We Want Our Model to Perform Well on Unseen Data

If our model performs well only on existing data, it’s closer to memorization. A good model, which is what we want, should perform well on unseen data.
